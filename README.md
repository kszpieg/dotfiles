# Installation
1. Clone the repository into `.dotfiles`:
```
git clone git@github.com:kszpieg/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
```
2. Run proper bash script:

- for full installation run `setup.sh` (it may require to provide sudo password during the process)
    ```
    cd ~/.dotfiles && chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh
    ```
- for only copy configs run `configs.sh` (it's contained in `setup.sh` so it's not necessary to run it separately)
    ```
    cd ~/.dotfiles && chmod +x configs.sh && ./configs.sh
    ```
3. Enjoy!
